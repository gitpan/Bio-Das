This is Bio::Das, a set of Perl modules for accessing genomic
annotations distributed using the Distributed Annotation System
(http://biodas.org).  To build, you need XML::Parser and LWP version 5
or higher.  Then it's just a matter of:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The tests attempt to contact the WormBase DAS server at
http://www.wormbase.org/db/das.  If this data source is down for some
reason, the tests may hang.  Don't give up; just try again later.

Full information on using this module is available in the POD
documentation.  Start with perldoc Bio::Das.  Then read
Bio::Das::Segment, Bio::Das::Segment::Feature, and Bio::Das::Type.

Graphics support for Bio::Das is available in the Bio::Graphics
package, which you can download from CPAN.  To use graphics you also
must install the GD module.  The file "testgraphics.pl" in the
Bio::Das distribution directory can be used to draw pictures from the
WormBase DAS server.
